## üîÑ State Management

- **Store Pattern**: Centralized state in `/store/` using NgRx Actions and Reducers,
- **Modular structure**: State divided in 3 main reducers: auth.reducer.ts, entrance-list.reducer.ts and user-data.reducer.ts,
- **Selectors & Effects**: Selectors to subscribe specific parts of state, effects make API calls to my NodeJS backend.
- **Reactive Data Flow**: RxJS observables for async data and UI state (username, hideIfNotLoggedIn, hideIfLoggedIn, themingService etc.).

## üñ•Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è UI/UX & Styling

- **Custom SCSS**: [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology, responsive mixins, and utility classes.
- **Typography**: Custom fonts (`Roboto`, `Afacad Flux`), scalable units, and accessible color palette.
- **Component Library**: Angular Material, custom icons, and SVGs.
