## üöÄ Technologies & Stack

- **Angular** (standalone components, OnPush change detection, RxJS)
- **TypeScript** (strict mode, type-safe interfaces)
- **SCSS** (modular, BEM, responsive, custom theming)
- **Angular Material** (custom palettes, theming, accessibility)
- **Service Worker** (PWA)
- **Nx Monorepo** (scalable workspace, project references)
- **ESLint** (custom rules, Angular best practices)
- **HammerJS** (touch gestures)
- **Responsive Design** (custom breakpoints, mobile-first)
- **Internationalization** (PL/EN language switch)
- **Custom Config Loader** (window globals for runtime config/data)
- **Lazy Loading** (assets, images, modules)
- **Accessibility** (keyboard navigation, ARIA, tooltips)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Patterns

- **Standalone Angular Components**: Modular, reusable, and tree-shakable.
- **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimized performance, explicit state management.
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS Subjects, Observables for state and events.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Feature modules, shared components, and services.
- **Custom Theming**: Angular Material palettes, SCSS variables, and mixins.
- **Configurable Data**: Runtime configuration via global JS objects for flexibility.
- **Responsive Layouts**: SCSS mixins, grid/flex layouts, adaptive UI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Landing Page**: Hero section with animated buttons, slider, and call-to-action.
- **Multi-language Support**: Seamless PL/EN switching, language-aware tooltips and content.
- **Interactive Sliders & Galleries**: Touch/swipe support, auto-slide, modal gallery.
- **Offer Cards**: Dynamic, data-driven, with icons, pricing, and external links.
- **Contact & Open Hours**: Configurable, with tooltips and direct actions (call, email, map).
- **Custom Playroom, Rent, Inflatables, Buffet & Workshop Sections**: Dedicated pages with offers and pricing tables.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA-friendly.
- **PWA Ready**: Service worker, manifest.
